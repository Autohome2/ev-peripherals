# ev-peripherals
Project to run several supporting components such as pumps, remote control, GPS, etc in a DIY electric car conversion.
Currently includes three temperature sensors. In my case one for each cooling loop which is motor, controller and batteries.

Unfortunately I do not have much experience as a programmer but enough to create flat code that works.
Making is more generic (object oriented) and thus easier to maintain and use is one of the to do's (see Wiki).
